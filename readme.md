# Web Developer Assignment – Cat Breed Gallery

## Objective

Build a web application that displays a list of cat breeds using the public Cat API. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to work with web technologies, structure a small application, and present data in a clear and user-friendly way.

## Requirements

Use the following API endpoint to fetch cat breed data:  
https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds

Each card should include:

- Cat image (use `reference_image_id.jpg` to construct it via the URL `https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/`) eg. https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/HOrX5gwLS.jpg
- Name
- Origin
- Temperament
- Life span
- A button labeled "Adopt Me"
- Every other info you think is nice to have

When the "Adopt Me" button is clicked:

- Simulate a POST request (e.g. using `fetch()` at the endpoint `https://echo.free.beeceptor.com/api/adopt`) as valid JSON
- Display a brief confirmation message or visual feedback
